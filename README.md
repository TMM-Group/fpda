## Description
This software features a user-friendly interface and implements a streamlined processing of VASP input and output files using Bash and Python languages. It includes modules for generating input files, extracting results, and analyzing properties, enabling convenient and efficient extraction of polarization intensity, dielectric constants, piezoelectric stress/strain constants, and other properties for ferroelectric materials. By offering a systematic analysis of these physical properties from the atomic and phononic scales, it significantly reduces the workload for users and improves the efficiency of property analysis for ferroelectric materials.

## Installation
1. To prepare the installation package in the Linux home directory (cd ~) and extract it with the decompression command (tar zxvf FPDA.0.0.1 .tar.gz) to preserve file permissions.
2. 
```
cd FPDA.0.0.1 
sh install.sh
```
Afterwards, follow the prompts to select your installation path.

3. 
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage
Upon entering 'fpda' in the command line, if the installation is successful, you will see the following interface:
